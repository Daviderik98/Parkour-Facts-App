        android:text="Alright, so the Philosophy of Parkour. In short terms it goes something like this: All physical obstacles are in reality opportunities for you to progress. They are there for you to overcome them. No matter how hard it may be you can still find a path through them. The only thing then that limits how far you can go is your mind. The Philosophy can also extend into everyday life. Say that you are either studying or hard at work, trying to handle a difficult relationship or the passing of someone close to you, or if you have kids to raise. Whatever you have in front of you it is extremely often your thoughts that limit what you actually achieve. Because while all aspects that make it hard are there for you to grow, they do not make you stop and give up. Your mind does. Every action and choice you make is the result of what is going on in your psyche. That is why mental strength is just as important as physicality. This is the Philosophy of Parkour: that you have the ability and the freedom to achieve what you want, with given time and practice and your belief that it is possible."
